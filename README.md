# Movie-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis based on movie reviews. The dataset is available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

The project is deployed online through flask framework.

### Nota bene
  - The main program will create and save automatically the model (the name is: model_best.hdf5).
  - Due to the size of the dataset (around 63 MB), the later one is not available on this repo; but you can download it on kaggle (link above).
